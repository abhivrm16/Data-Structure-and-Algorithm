121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.



Naive approach : // to find max value for every particular element thus two for loops
    O(N^2)

Best approach: o(N)


   
        // keep record of min value
        // keep record of max profit with each array elements
       maxprofit=Math.max(maxprofit,prices[i]-minVal);


class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        
        
        // keep record of min value
        // keep record of max profit with each array elements
       
        int maxprofit=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int minVal=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++)
        {
            minVal=Math.min(prices[i],minVal);
            maxprofit=Math.max(maxprofit,prices[i]-minVal);
            
        }
        
        return maxprofit;
        
    }
}
